# Keystore SPI
* **Status**: Draft #1

## Motivation

This document proposes a new SPI called "KeyStore".
The purpose of the SPI is to allow an arbitrary number of key stores to be provisioned.
It also proposes a unified API for handling both credentials and trust anchors, allowing provisioning to be done using both key store files (PKCS#12 or JKS) and PEM files.
Intended consumers for the API are the various TLS clients and servers in Keycloak.

Currently, the configuration of key stores depends on the TLS client/server implementation and there are a couple of alternatives.
The JDK default KeyStore is used for clients that rely on the default SSL socket factory.
HTTPS server uses credentials set using Quarkus properties.

For TrustStores, Keycloak currently implements TrustStore SPI.
It allows users to provide a single additional TrustStore (besides the JDK default), which is supported in specific use cases (see table).
Since TrustStore SPI provides only one TrustStore the same set of CA certificates will be shared for all uses.
For example, it is not possible to differentiate between the CA certificates used to validate the LDAP server certificate and the CA certificate that X.509 client certificate authenticator uses to validate client certificates, even though these two might be completely different PKI domains.

Table: Current TrustStore SPI users

| User | Socket<br>factory | TrustStore or<br>CA certificates | Validation<br>policy | Usage description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `LDAPContextManager` | &check; | | | SSL context for LDAPS and StartTLS |
| `LDAPOperationManager`  | &check; | | | SSL context for LDAPS and StartTLS |
| `LdapMapContextManager` | &check; | | | SSL context for LDAPS and StartTLS |
| `LdapMapOperationManager`  | &check; | | | SSL context for LDAPS and StartTLS |
| `CertificateValidator` |  | &check; | | X.509 client certificate authenticator |
| `WebAuthnRegisterFactory` |  | &check; | | WebAuthn attestation |
| `DefaultHttpClientFactory` |  | &check; | &check; | TrustStore for HTTP client, server certificate validation policy |
| `NginxProxySslClientCertificateLookup`|  | &check; | | X.509 client certificate validation |
| `CRLUtils` |  | &check; | | X.509 client certificate authenticator |
| `DefaultEmailSenderProvider` | &check; | | &check; | SSL context for SMTPS and StartTLS |


## Use cases

KeyStore SPI shall support the following use cases:

1. The administrator can configure several individual key stores.
2. KeyStore SPI consumer requests KeyStore using an identifier(s) assigned to it, where the identifier is used to select one of the configured key stores.
3. The administrator can provision both credentials and trust anchors with KeyStore SPI.
4. The administrator can configure key stores in PKCS#12 and JKS format, as well as directly as PEM files.
5. The administrator can renew TLS client and server credentials by swapping the file(s) on disk, without requiring a server restart.

Note: it is not necessary to migrate existing TrustStore SPI users to KeyStore SPI even if the use case to (3) provision trust anchors using KeyStore SPI is supported.
However, it could be beneficial in the future for a unified API to be used for both credentials and trust anchors.

## Design proposal

The API proposal for KeyStore SPI is following

```java
public interface KeyStoreProvider extends Provider {

    /**
     * Load KeyStore of a given identifier.
     *
     * @param keyStoreIdentifier Identifier of the wanted KeyStore.
     * @return KeyStore.
     */
    KeyStore loadKeyStore(String keyStoreIdentifier);

    /**
     * Loads KeyStore of given identifier and returns a KeyStore.Builder.
     * Builder encapsulates both KeyStore and KeyEntry password(s).
     *
     * @param keyStoreIdentifier Identifier of the wanted KeyStore.
     * @return Builder for KeyStore.
     */

    KeyStore.Builder loadKeyStoreBuilder(String keyStoreIdentifier);

}
```

The identifier is a string that is used to select the correct KeyStore from the configured key stores.
The method `loadKeyStore()` returns `KeyStore` which can be used with `TrustManager` since no password is required.
The method `loadKeyStoreBuilder()` returns [`KeyStore.Builder`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/security/KeyStore.Builder.html) which can be used with `KeyManager` as well, since the builder encapsulates `KeyEntry` passwords as well, which are required to access the private keys.

The key store identifier is a hierarchical name that identifies the key store.
For example, the following names could be used:

| Key store identifier | Description |
|---|---|
| ldap-client-keystore | Key store that includes client certificate, private key and chain certificates for LDAP client |
| ldap-client-truststore | Key store that includes CA certificates for LDAP client |

## Implementation details

### Support for hot-reloading client and server credentials

Currently, Keycloak needs to be manually restarted for example when HTTPS server credentials are renewed.
Why is this a problem?
Let's Encrypt recommends renewing certificates [every 60 days](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/faq/#what-is-the-lifetime-for-let-s-encrypt-certificates-for-how-long-are-they-valid).
A lot shorter renewal period may be used in certain deployments as internal "private" PKI certificates, even down to hours or minutes.
It becomes inconvenient to restart Keycloak every time certificate is rotated.
For critical and highly available services it would be desirable to support automatic certificate reload after rotation.

The default KeyStore SPI implementation shall implement hot-reload support.
JDK `KeyStore` internally provides [`KeyStoreSpi`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/security/KeyStoreSpi.html) which is meant to be used to build custom KeyStores.
Default KeyStore SPI shall provide a custom implementation of `KeyStoreSpi` that reloads the KeyStore from disk when the files have been changed.

### Support for PEM files

The default KeyStore SPI implementation shall support loading KeyStore from PEM files.
This allows aligning the configuration of different TLS interfaces that Keycloak has.
Currently, PEM files are supported for the HTTPS credentials.
Internally the PEM files can be loaded into `KeyStore`, allowing consumers to remain unaware of the format on disk.

## Milestones

1. Implement KeyStore SPI and default implementation.
2. Finalize [SASL EXTERNAL pull request](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/pull/7365) which initially triggered the work on KeyStore SPI, by utilizing KeyStore SPI for loading client certificate.
3. Migrate HTTPS server to use KeyStore SPI to allow Keycloak to hot-reload server credentials.
Neither Quarkus or Vert.X support hot-reload but Keycloak can pass `KeyManager` with hot-reloading `KeyStore` to Quarkus (enabled by following PR https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/pull/27682).
